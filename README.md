### Philanthropy_Research_Project.html/.rmd
These files were created for my final research project for my sociology class, Data and Society, and present preliminary analysis on what motivates people to donate their money and resources to particular causes.
### Lox Interpreter
These Java files were written when I followed along with the tutorials in "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom, and are an interpreter for the Lox programming language.
